            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm an 18-year-old with a passion for learning, particularly in the realm of coding. Alongside my interest in programming, I find joy in playing video games and staying physically active, often hitting the basketball court for some fun. Balancing my hobbies with responsibility, I also contribute to our family business through a part-time job with my parents. Eager to expand my skills and experiences in both technology and entrepreneurship, I embrace each day as an opportunity for growth and exploration.</p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                In my journey, I've gained valuable experiences in both family business and web development. Working alongside my family, I've learned the importance of teamwork and entrepreneurship. In web development, I've honed my skills in coding and design, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create engaging digital experiences. Additionally, my involvement in basketball competitions has taught me the value of determination and teamwork. These diverse experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual, equipped with skills and a passion for making a positive impact in both professional and personal pursuits.</p>
